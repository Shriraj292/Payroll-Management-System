# Payroll Management System
This project is based on actual implementation of OOPs concepts. I have implemented inheritence, abstraction and encapsulation for now. Other concepts will be implemented when new features are added to the scope of project.
This project represents how OOPs concepts can be implemented in real time projects.

Thanks for visiting!
